# Remove Tag Tool

The *Remove Tag Tool* is an addon for the genealogy program [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/introduction-WP/). It allows you to remove a tag from several people at once.

## Installation
You can manually install this addon by downloading it and copying it into your [Gramps User Directory](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.0_Wiki_Manual_-_User_Directory)

This is my first addon project for Gamps. It was created by rewriting the *Set Attribute Tool*. [Backing up](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_make_a_backup) your family tree before using it is recomended.
