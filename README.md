# Remove Tag Tool

The *Remove Tag Tool* is an addon for the genealogical research software [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/introduction-WP/). Instead of eliminating a tag from various persons separately, this addon allows to remove tags from a group of persons of a predefined person filter at once.

## Installation
You can manually install this addon by downloading it and copying it into your [Gramps User Directory](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_5.0_Wiki_Manual_-_User_Directory)

This is my first addon project for Gramps. It was created by rewriting the *Set Attribute Tool*. [Backing up](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/How_to_make_a_backup) your family tree before using it is recommended.
